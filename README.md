# reproducibility_nscr

This repository contains materials for the presentation on reproducibility for NSCR on June 24th, 2021

Specific notes:

- To knit the slides yourself you need to have a working LaTeX distribution installed on your computer
- The slides themselves are created by the R package binb (strange recursive acronym "binb is not beamer"; you need to have that one installed as well
